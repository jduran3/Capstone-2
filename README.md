# Marketing based on Income Classification

Businesses want to be effective in their marketing campaign efforts to maximize value by targeting the right customer segment, but sometimes they struggle to accomplish this. If businesses can predict a customer's income based on other pieces of known information, they can target certain products and services more effectively.

The intention of this analysis is to better understand what characteristics can predict whether a customer's income is greater than $50k USD based on US Census data. With the information obtained in this analysis, our target is to build a predictive classification model to segment people with income greater than $50k USD with a 85% precision.

The dataset for this project was obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/adult)
